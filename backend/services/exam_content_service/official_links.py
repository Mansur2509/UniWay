"""Static, non-invented links to official exam registration/date pages.

Unlike SAT/AP (backed by verified ``OfficialExamDate`` rows), EduVerse has no
verified date dataset for IELTS/TOEFL. Rather than guessing or scraping live
dates, these are stable links to each test's official organization so a
student can check current dates themselves. No date, deadline, or score is
ever invented here.
