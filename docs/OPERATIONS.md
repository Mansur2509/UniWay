## Backend cold starts (Render free tier)

### Problem

The backend is deployed on Render's free tier, which spins the service down
after ~15 minutes with no inbound traffic. The first request after a spin-down
is a **cold start**: Render boots a fresh container and only then serves the
request. Measured behaviour:

| State | `/api/v1/health/` response time |
| --- | --- |
| Cold (after >15 min idle) | **hung past 90s** on the first request |
| Warm (subsequent requests) | **~0.8s**, consistent across 10 consecutive runs |

This single fact explains every symptom reported for the Universities, Event
Map, Essays, and Applications pages:

- **"Infinite spinner that never resolves"** — the first request hit a
  cold-starting backend, and the frontend had no request timeout, so the
  browser's `fetch` stayed pending indefinitely.
- **"We could not load…" error** — the cold start eventually exceeded a network
  limit and the connection was reset, so `fetch` rejected and the screen showed
  its (correct) error state.
- **"Sometimes fast, sometimes very slow" (Event Map)** — warm vs. cold; the
  data and query are identical, only the container state differs.
- **"Blank page, no spinner, no error" (Essays)** — a *separate* bug (see
  below), not cold start.

The endpoints themselves are healthy. With the backend warm, all four return
`200` with valid JSON (Universities ~35 KB, Events ~2.5 KB, Essays/Applications
empty lists for a new user). CORS is correctly configured (the Vercel origin is
whitelisted, verified via an `OPTIONS` preflight), the Events query already uses
`select_related` + a count annotation (no N+1), and Supabase RLS does not block
Django (it connects server-side and returns full data).

### The blank-page bug (separate root cause)

The Essays "completely blank, no feedback" state was **not** cold start. The app
had **no React error boundary** anywhere in the tree, and the i18n `t()` helper
threw (`undefined.replace(...)`) when given a missing/dynamic key. Any
render-time throw therefore unmounted the whole route into a blank page. Fixed
by (a) adding `app/error.tsx` + `app/global-error.tsx`, and (b) making `t()`
fall back to the key instead of throwing.

## Mitigations

Three options, in order of cost:

### 1. Keep-alive ping (free, implemented)

`.github/workflows/keepalive.yml` pings `/api/v1/health/` every 10 minutes via
GitHub Actions, keeping the service warm during active hours. Best-effort:
GitHub cron can lag a few minutes and is disabled after 60 days of repo
inactivity. For a stronger free guarantee, point an external monitor
(UptimeRobot, cron-job.org) at the same health URL on a 5-10 minute interval.

### 2. Frontend resilience + honest UX (implemented)

Even with keep-alive, a cold start can still happen (e.g. first visit of the
day). The frontend now degrades gracefully instead of hanging or going blank:

- **Request timeout + auto-retry** — `apiRequest` caps every call at
  `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` (60s) and converts a timeout/network failure into a
  typed `ApiError` rather than hanging forever. Because the first failed request
  is also what *triggers* the Render wake-up, safe idempotent GET reads are
  automatically retried once after ~2.5s, so a page self-heals through a cold
  start instead of forcing the user to press "Try again". Non-GET requests are
  never auto-retried.
- **"Waking up" messaging** — if any load takes longer than 5s, the loading
  state adds: *"The server may be waking up. The first load after a period of
  inactivity can take up to a minute."* Applied to the auth/session gate (the
  first request on app load) and to the Universities, Event Map, Essays, and
  Applications screens.
- **Error boundaries** — `app/error.tsx` and `app/global-error.tsx` guarantee a
  clear, retryable message instead of a blank page for any render-time error.

### 3. Upgrade Render (paid, recommended for launch)

Render's **Starter** instance type (~$7/month per service at time of writing)
does **not** spin down, eliminating cold starts entirely. Recommended before any
public launch or live admissions-reviewer demo, where a 60-90s first-load delay
is unacceptable and keep-alive's best-effort guarantee is too weak. Until then,
options 1 + 2 are the interim solution.

## Web-service startup must stay light

Render starts the web service with
`migrate --noinput && ensure_demo_accounts && gunicorn …` (configured in the
Render dashboard, not in this repo — confirmed against production on
2026-07-15) and kills the deploy if gunicorn does not open its port within the
port-scan window. Nothing heavy may run before gunicorn binds:

- **Migrations** must be schema-only / tiny. A data migration that did the XLSX
  university import was reverted to a no-op for exactly this reason
  (`university_service/0006`).
- **`seed_demo`** no longer seeds universities/events/exams on startup. The full
  demo dataset (which `update_or_create`s university rows and can hit a Supabase
  `statement timeout` while locking tuples) is gated behind `--with-demo-data`;
  the default only promotes allow-listed admins. For an explicit startup that does
  no seeding at all, use `python manage.py migrate --noinput && python manage.py
  bootstrap_admins && gunicorn …`.
- Bulk imports run **out-of-band** (admin-only `/admin/university-import` UI, or
  the `import_universities_xlsx` command), never during startup.
- Admin import jobs must not stay `running` indefinitely. The job runner stores
  row progress and `last_heartbeat_at`; if a running job is older than the stale
  window without a heartbeat, the admin status endpoint marks it failed with an
  explicit timeout message. Review the catalog for partial writes before
  rerunning because the importer is idempotent but production data should still
  be inspected.

## Supabase RLS cleanup (tracked, not blocking)

Supabase reports RLS warnings because Django created tables in the public
schema. This is a security-hardening follow-up, **not** a functional bug: Django
uses a server-side connection that is not subject to RLS, which is why all
endpoints return real data. Tracked for a later security pass.
