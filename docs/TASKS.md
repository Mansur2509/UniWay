## Phase 1 — Core vertical slices

- [x] **AUTH-001** Implement basic JWT registration, login, refresh, blacklist logout, current-user/profile API, frontend auth state, protected pages, and auth tests.
- [x] **UI-SYSTEM-001** Add semantic dark-first theme tokens and migrate shared/auth/profile/dashboard UI.
- [x] **I18N-001** Add dependency-free typed dictionaries, locale persistence, four locales, and a language switcher.
- [ ] **AUTH-002** Add email verification, password reset, HttpOnly refresh cookies, session/device management, and production auth hardening.
- [x] **PROFILE-001** Implement the self-only student profile aggregate, academic/contact fields, computed completion, localized responsive UI, migration, and tests.
- [x] **PROFILE-STRUCTURED-001** Implement 7 structured admissions profile item types (Activities, Honors, Olympiads, Sports, Research Projects, Essay Drafts, Portfolio Projects) with full CRUD APIs, permission-based access control, reusable frontend components, 4-language i18n, and comprehensive test coverage. All verifications passed: 53/53 backend tests, TypeScript type checks, ESLint linting, Next.js production build, and i18n parity (984 keys across 4 locales).
- [x] **EVENTS-001** Implement event lifecycle, public catalog/detail, profile-snapshot registration, cancellation, my events, localized UI, seed data, migration, and tests.
- [ ] **EVENTS-002** Build Leaflet map/calendar views, save action, and richer eligibility/recommendation filters.
- [x] **UNI-001 / UNIVERSITY-DATABASE-001 / ADMISSIONS-CALCULATOR-001** Implement university catalog search/filter, detail pages, 2-4-way comparison, self-only shortlist, and an admissions fit analysis (Reach/Competitive/Target/Safety) computed only from verified profile and university data, with "Not verified yet" honest empty states everywhere a statistic is unconfirmed. Backend: extended `University` model with nullable admissions fields, `SavedUniversity` shortlist model, `fit`/`shortlist`/`compare` actions on `UniversityViewSet`, pure fit-calculation helpers in `services.py`, 8 fictional demo universities with deliberately partial seed data. Frontend: `/universities`, `/universities/[slug]`, `/universities/compare` routes. All verifications passed: 84/84 backend tests, ruff clean, TypeScript clean, ESLint clean, Next.js build (24 routes), i18n parity (1059 keys x 4 locales). Manually verified end-to-end in the local beta (search/filter, detail, shortlist persistence across refresh, 2- and 4-way compare, fit analysis, no horizontal overflow or double scrollbar at 390px width). Found and fixed a floating-point boundary bug in the GPA-difference threshold check during manual QA.
- [x] **UNIVERSITY-DATA-VERIFICATION-001** Replace the fictional-only catalog with 15 real, source-backed universities (Penn, Princeton, Cornell, CMU, NYU, MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Toronto, UBC, Oxford, Cambridge, Bocconi, NUS, KAIST), each researched via direct official-page fetches/search-result relay (never invented). Added `is_demo` to `University` (default catalog list now excludes the 8 fictional demo records; `?include_demo=true` opts back in) and a new `UniversityFieldVerification` model giving every non-null admissions/stat/cost/deadline field a `source_url`, `last_verified_date`, and `verified`/`partial`/`estimated` status, enforced by a seed-data integrity test. Added `admissions_url`, `financial_aid_url`, `application_portal_url`, `test_policy`, `ielts_minimum`, `sat_p25`/`sat_p75`, `essay_requirements`, `qs_ranking`/`qs_ranking_year` fields. Frontend shows a `VerifiedStat` badge (Verified/Partial/Estimated) with last-verified date and source link per field, "Not verified yet" for anything unconfirmed, and a "Demo data" badge on fictional records. Fit analysis gained a `limited_data_for_category` next-action so a category assigned from only one verified statistic is never presented as a complete picture. All verifications passed: 94/94 backend tests, ruff clean, `makemigrations --check` clean, TypeScript clean, ESLint clean, Next.js build (24 routes), i18n parity (1079 keys x 4 locales). Manually verified end-to-end: real universities appear by default and demo ones are hidden until opted in, Harvard/MIT/NUS/Stanford each render the correct mix of Verified/Partial/"Not verified yet" fields, fit analysis correctly returns "Not enough verified data" for NUS despite its rich non-quantitative data, shortlist and 3-way real-university comparison work, no horizontal overflow or double scrollbar at 390px.
- [x] **ROAD-001 / ROADMAP-GENERATOR-001** Implement a deterministic, rule-based personalized admissions roadmap: profile-gap detection (activities/honors/research/portfolio/essays), exam gaps (SAT/IELTS/AP/planned exams), university deadline countdowns (60/30/7-day + final, sourced from `UniversityFieldVerification` when available), scholarship tasks, fit-analysis-driven weak-dimension tasks, and event-registration reminders. No AI; every task traces to a profile fact, a verified university statistic, or an explicitly-labeled estimated planning window. Backend: new `roadmap_service` app with `RoadmapPlan`/`RoadmapTask`/`RoadmapTaskDependency` models, idempotent `roadmap_generator.py` (stable `dedup_key` per task so regeneration only adds new tasks, never duplicates or deletes), `RoadmapPlanView`/`GenerateRoadmapView`/`RoadmapTaskViewSet` (self-only, manual tasks fully editable/deletable, generated tasks editable except category and never deletable — skip instead) under `/api/roadmap/`. Frontend: full `/roadmap` screen (header, 5 overview cards, category/priority/status/university filters, This week/This month/Later/Completed task board, timeline mode, manual task create/edit form, empty states), a dashboard "next 3 tasks + urgent count" widget, and a "View in roadmap" link on shortlisted university detail pages. All verifications passed: 118/118 backend tests, ruff clean, `makemigrations --check` clean, TypeScript clean, ESLint clean, Next.js build (24 routes, `/roadmap` included), i18n parity (1168 keys x 4 locales). Manually verified end-to-end in the local beta with the seeded demo student: generated 14 tasks from real shortlist/exam-plan/event-registration data, completed and skipped both generated and manual tasks (persisted across refresh), timeline mode sorted correctly, no horizontal overflow or double scrollbar at 390px. Caught and fixed a real bug during QA: `DefaultRouter`'s auto-generated API-root view was silently intercepting `GET /api/roadmap/` ahead of the intended plan view.
- [ ] **ESSAY-001** Implement private essay submission and feedback contracts with strict no-ghostwriting controls.
- [ ] **AI-001** Implement backend OpenRouter adapter, quotas, usage logs, safety policy, prompt-injection defenses, and provider fallback.
- [ ] **EXAM-001** Implement original question authoring/admin, practice sessions, answers, explanations, and scoring foundations.
- [ ] **FIN-001** Implement educational finance modules and quizzes with mandatory advice disclaimer.
- [ ] **SUB-001** Implement plan definitions, feature access rules, atomic usage counters, and monthly reset job.
